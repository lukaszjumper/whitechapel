# About project

Thereâ€™s no better training environment for a mathematician than a board game: as a pre-simplified,
axiomatic reality where the player willingly chooses to enter, every mathematical result holds an
immediate impact on the whole gameplay.
Our aim was to get as close as possible to finding a winning strategy for the game Letters from
Whitechapel (by Gabriele Mari and Gianluca Santopietro), an Italian-made, 21st-century, non-random,
complete information, asymmetrical, two-sides competitive game. It takes place on an unusual board
formed by two interconnected graphs, where a team of five policemen hunts down Jack the Ripper.
